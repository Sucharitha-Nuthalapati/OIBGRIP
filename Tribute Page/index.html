            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Jobs was born in San Francisco to a Syrian father and a German-American mother. He was adopted shortly after his birth. 
            Jobs attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India seeking enlightenment 
            and studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. A year later, 
            the duo gained fame and wealth with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced 
            microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user 
            interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 
            1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the 
            addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics.</br></br>

            In 1985, Jobs was forced out of Apple after a long power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO John Sculley. 
            That same year, Jobs took a few Apple employees with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized
             in computers for higher-education and business markets. In addition, he helped to develop the visual effects industry when he 
             funded the computer graphics division of George Lucas's Lucasfilm in 1986. The new company was Pixar, which produced the first 
             3D computer-animated feature film Toy Story (1995) and went on to become a major animation studio, producing over 25 films 
             since.</br></br>
                
            In 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the company's acquisition of NeXT. He was largely responsible for reviving Apple, 
            which was on the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with English designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products that had 
            larger cultural ramifications, beginning with the "Think different" advertising campaign and leading to the Apple Store, App 
            Store, iMac, iPad, iPod, iPhone, iTunes, and iTunes Store. In 2001, the original Mac OS was replaced with the completely new 
            Mac OS X (now known as macOS), based on NeXT's NeXTSTEP platform, giving the operating system a modern Unix-based foundation 
            for the first time. In 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. He died of respiratory arrest related 
            to the tumor on October 5, 2011 at the age of 56.
